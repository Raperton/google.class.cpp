// Description: 

// Your college book store needs your help in estimating its business for next year. 
// Experience has shown that sales depend greatly on whether a book is required for a 
// course or just optional, and whether or not it has been used in the class before. 
// A new, required textbook will sell to 90% of prospective enrollment, but if it has 
// been used in the class before, only 65% will buy. 
// Similarly, 40% of prospective enrollment will buy a new, optional textbook, but if 
// it has been used in the class before only 20% will buy. 
// (Note that "used" here does not mean second-hand books.)

// Write a program that accepts as input a series of books (until the user enters a sentinel).

// For each book ask for: 
//   - a code for the book, 
//   - the single copy cost for the book, 
//   - the current number of books on hand, 
//   - the prospective class enrollment, 
//   - data that indicates if the book is required/optional
//   - new/used in past. 

// As output, 
//   - show all the input information in a nicely formatted screen 
//   - how many books must be ordered (if any, note that only new books are ordered),
//   - the total cost of each orders.


// Then, after all input is complete.

// show:
//     - the total cost of all book orders
//     - the expected profit if the store pays 80% of list price
//     - process one book at a time
//     - show the output screen for that book.
 
// Then, when the user has finished entering all the data.
//   your program should output:
//   - the total
//   - profit values.

// Before you start writing code, take some time to think about design of this program. 
// Decompose into a set of functions, and create a main() function that reads like an outline 
// for your solution to the problem. Make sure each function does one task.

int main(){
  
  // accept a series of books.
  // for each book:
  // ask for the code
  // ask the single copy cost
  // ask the current number of books on hand
  // the prospective class enrollement
  // is it required or optional
  // is it new of used.

  // show:
  // total cost of books ordered
  // expected profit it the store pays 80% of list price
  // process one book at a time
  // show the output screen for that book.

  //output total
  // output profil values.
